# API

An expressjs API that wraps the PUBG API as well as providing additional functionality for \#SquadGoals - tbd if it will serve the ui in the future.

## Developing

You can develop on `squadgoals-api` independently, but consider using the instructions in `squadgoals` to run both solutions in parallel.
